/**
 * The iOS keyboard repeats a held ⌫ only while the focused field has text: in an empty field it
 * sends one keydown and stops. xterm's helper textarea is empty almost all the time:
 * a typed key is sent on keydown and cancelled, and xterm empties the field after Backspace,
 * Enter, ^C and blur. So a held ⌫ deleted one character and stopped (#862). Leaving one
 * character in the empty field keeps the repeat going: each repeat is a keydown xterm sends as
 * DEL and cancels, so the character itself is never deleted and never reaches the pty.
 * The field must also wrap: with xterm's `white-space: nowrap` the iOS 27 keyboard sent one ⌫
 * and stopped even with text in it (measured in the simulator's Safari).
