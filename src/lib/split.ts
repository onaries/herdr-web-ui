 * Two panes side by side on a desktop, as a window snapped to half the screen: a tab, a sidebar or
 * Agents row, or a pane's title dragged to the left or right half of the pane area opens its pane
 * there, beside the one already open. The selected pane (App's) is the active half's; the other half
 * keeps its own. The halves are independent: both may show the same tab (the other half draws it on a
 * connection of its own), and a pick from the sidebar changes the active half alone.
 *
 * The halves are two slots, `a` and `b`, that keep their panes when the active one changes or the
 * halves trade sides, so neither terminal attaches again for a click. A single pane is shown in
 * one of them (App's solo slot, `a` at first); split, `b` is on `bSide` and `a` on the other side.
 * The half left when a split ends stays in its slot, so its terminal keeps its connection.
