 *
 * Hand-written on purpose: herdr's schema maps a method to its params (`request.oneOf`), but its
 * answers are one `ResponseResult.oneOf` told apart by a `type` tag (`pane_process_info`,
 * `agent_info`, `ok`) with no link back to the method, so a generated method -> result table
 * would be a hand-kept table anyway. The params and result bodies come from the generated types
 * (scripts/generate-protocol-types.ts ROOTS).
