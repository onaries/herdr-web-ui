# Remote PCs over SSH

Use **Add PC** in Settings → Remote PCs (the command palette has it too) to connect a Linux or macOS computer (x64 or arm64) or a Windows PC (x64) running OpenSSH Server. Enter an SSH alias or `user@hostname`; the name defaults to that address. Advanced settings accept a port, a key path on the **web server**, and a named herdr session. Each registration selects one herdr socket. The sidebar groups PC → workspace → pane, and the header and new-session dialog show the destination PC.

The connection server uses its own operating-system account’s OpenSSH configuration and ssh-agent. The browser never opens SSH itself. Existing keys are tried first; unknown host fingerprints and password/key-passphrase prompts appear in the setup dialog. Secret entry requires HTTPS or localhost. Verify a new fingerprint against the target PC. A changed host key fails closed; correcting trust is a deliberate administrator action, not an automatic reset.

After inspection, **Install and connect** lists the proposed changes. The installer uses a private runtime bundle containing Bun, Node and native node-pty, plus a pinned herdr fallback. It uses an existing herdr where available, starts a daemon only when its socket is absent, and never stops/replaces a running herdr daemon. Agent CLI installation and login remain the remote account’s responsibility. Cancelling a setup closes its SSH processes; already-created remote work is preserved.

Password or encrypted-key authentication also offers registration of an app-specific ed25519 key for unattended reconnection. The private key stays on the connection server under `<stateDir>/ssh/<machine-id>`, mode `0600`; only its public key is appended to the remote account’s `authorized_keys`. The original SSH keys/configuration are preserved. One-time secrets pass through a private askpass Unix socket in memory; they are not stored in jobs or configuration files.

### Windows PCs

Setup first asks the PC in `sh`; one that cannot run it (cmd or PowerShell as the OpenSSH default shell, whichever) is asked again in PowerShell, as a base64 `-EncodedCommand` that both shells pass through untouched. The bundle for `win32-x64` carries Bun only, under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\herdr-web-ui\remote-v<N>` (a junction to a checksum-named release directory). herdr is not bundled: an installed one is used (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Herdr\bin\herdr.exe`, the stable alias its installer keeps), and otherwise setup runs herdr's own `install.cmd` from herdr.dev, which the approval list names. The bundle goes over by sftp, since PowerShell owns a redirected stdin. Registrations live in `%USERPROFILE%\.config\herdr-web-ui\bridges\`; the bridge and the herdr daemon are started through WMI (`Win32_Process.Create`), outside the SSH session's and the bridge's job objects, so they survive the logout and each other. The app key goes to `%ProgramData%\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys` for an administrator account (what Windows OpenSSH reads for one) and to `.ssh\authorized_keys` otherwise. herdr's socket there is a named pipe; the `herdr.sock` file is a `pid:start` marker.

herdr has no `terminal attach` on Windows yet ([herdrdev/herdr#4821](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr/issues/4821)), so a Windows PC reports `terminal_attach: false` and `terminal_mirror: true`. The chat lens works as on any PC (transcripts, status, prompts, files and input). The terminal lens is a stopgap: the bridge reads the pane's visible screen a few times a second (`pane.read`, ansi) and repaints it in the browser, so output and colours show and typing works, sent through `pane.send_text`. What a repaint cannot give: the cursor is not shown, output that comes and goes between two reads is not seen, and the grid is the pane's own size on that PC (`pane-geometry` with `fixed: true`), never the browser's. The real terminal does not turn on by itself: it also needs the PTY sidecar (Node and `@lydell/node-pty`), which the `win32-x64` bundle does not ship, so a bridge without it keeps mirroring whatever herdr reports. It takes over once herdr attaches on Windows and a bundle ships the sidecar. WSL gives a Linux herdr, not the native Windows session.

## Runtime and endpoints

```
Browser → connection server → OpenSSH local forward → remote loopback bridge → herdr Unix socket
```

The bridge reuses this backend, so conversations, file searches, directory validation and pasted images run on the selected PC. Only a loopback bridge port is opened on that PC. OpenSSH forwards it over the authenticated connection; see [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5).

The current server keeps one status-only WebSocket per remote PC without attaching to a terminal. SSE carries the combined roster and status events to the browser. Selected terminals use a separate WebSocket bound to one machine for its entire lifetime. Roles and output ACKs pass through unchanged: the browser acknowledges only after xterm parses output. The relay also enforces a 1 MiB transport budget and a 2-second stalled-consumer close (`4008`).

| Route | Contract |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/health?scope=bridge` | App/auth liveness independent of local herdr |
| `GET /api/bridge` | Authenticated protocol, runtime version, PID and socket identity |
| `GET /api/machines` | PC state plus cached snapshots |
| `GET /api/machines/events` | SSE roster and machine-scoped status events |
| `POST /api/machines/setup` | Create an interactive setup job |
| `GET/POST/DELETE /api/machines/setup/:id` | Inspect, answer/approve, cancel |
| `PATCH /api/machines/:id` | Rename or change `enabled` |
| `DELETE /api/machines/:id` | Forget the PC and remove its local private key |
| `/api/machines/:id/{session,agents,pane/*,workspace/*}` | Allowlisted target API routes |
| `/ws?machine_id=…` | Immutable terminal destination |

Legacy HTTP paths, `/ws` without a machine, and old stored preferences/notification links mean **local**. Machine mutations require `X-Herdr-Machine: 1`, the existing token gate and same-origin browser requests. The proxy passes a bridge credential read through SSH; browser cookies, bearer tokens, forwarded headers and remote cookies are not forwarded. Authentication, push devices, VAPID keys and app updates belong to the current connection server.

Remote credentials are registered in `~/.config/herdr-web-ui/bridges/` on that PC (mode `0600`). A compatible bridge for the same socket is reused, including a normally started server from this version. Independently managed bridges are never stopped by remote setup. Older unregistered bridges can still hold an exclusive terminal attach; release their browser attachment or restart them with registration support. Automatic attaches and reconnects never use `--takeover`. With a bridge that advertises support,
**Open here** on a pane's waiting notice explicitly takes its terminal. The displaced web bridge
waits; a standalone `herdr terminal attach` exits. The herdr TUI stays connected (verified on
herdr 0.9.3). Older bridge bundles keep waiting until updated, and observe connections cannot take a pane.

## Disconnects and updates

**Update bridge** also reuses a bridge whose live identity verifies as current; it does not
download, install or restart the same version again.

**Multiple apps connecting to one PC.** Keep those apps on the same version. An older app
with this protection refuses to downgrade a newer bridge and asks you to update the app itself.
Apps from before this version can still replace a newer bridge. If another app
starts an incompatible bridge during an update, setup reports a **Bridge connection conflict**
instead of offering an automatic update loop. Update or disconnect the other app before retrying.
The update path never takes over a terminal or stops herdr sessions.

PC registrations and last snapshots persist in `<stateDir>/machines.json`; `HERDR_WEB_STATE_DIR` chooses the state directory. A disconnected PC retains its last roster with controls disabled. Retries back off from 1 second to 60 seconds. Other PCs keep working. Reconnection never changes a non-empty selection or sends held input. Composer drafts, held messages, terminal drafts, lenses, recent panes and notification identities include both machine and pane. Held messages have an explicit **Send now** action.

**Disconnect** closes that PC’s observer, forwards and terminal attachments, preserving remote processes. **Remove PC** additionally forgets its local registration/key; the public key line on the remote account remains visible for manual removal (`herdr-web-ui:<machine-id>`). No unrelated authorized keys are removed.

**Updating a bridge.** A bridge from another bundle version is refused, and the PC waits instead of retrying. With **Settings → Remote PCs → Update PC bridges automatically** on (the default), the connection server then updates it in the background: installing the app update was the approval, and SSH uses the PC's saved key only (`BatchMode`). A PC that needs a password or passphrase fails with the reason and waits; its **Sign in and update…** button opens the dialog. An update that cannot reach the PC (switched off, asleep, off the network, or gone in the middle) says nothing about its bridge: the PC shows **Reconnecting…** and keeps retrying, and the version check, with its update, runs again once the PC answers. A cancelled update (its **Cancel update**, a closed dialog, the setup's time limit) also sends the PC back to reconnecting; if the bridge is still out of date when the PC answers, it shows the **Update bridge** button and does not start the cancelled update again by itself until the PC has connected. With the setting off, the PC's **Update bridge** button starts the same background update, and the tap is the approval. A first install still asks for approval in the dialog.

The dialog offers the update itself: a connect or reconnect that is refused on the version check turns its **Retry connection** into **Update bridge and connect**, which re-runs the setup with the bridge update included — through the same approval list a first install shows, so a PC that was never registered (and has no sidebar row) can be updated and connected in one go.

The update runs on the server, not in a dialog: closing the dialog after approval, or never opening one, does not stop it, and **Cancel update** does. The sidebar and the header show the step (download, upload to the PC, verify and install, restart), the bytes, and roughly how long is left. The connection server keeps the verified bundle under `<stateDir>/bundles/<sha256>.tgz` (the newest four), downloads each checksum once even for PCs updating together, and streams the file to the PC instead of holding it in memory.

A verified runtime is installed into a checksum-addressed directory before the selected managed bridge is restarted. Existing runtime directories remain available to other running bridges. The updater authenticates the old bridge and checks its socket, managed ownership and PID before stopping it. An approved replacement may have a different bridge protocol, but the new bridge must match the current protocol and bundle version before connecting; herdr itself is left running. A separately managed server must use its own update controls. The connection server's own app update (Settings → Updates) is separate from these bridge updates.

An independently managed server is detected before downloading or installing a remote bundle and
does not enter the automatic bridge-update queue. Update its app through its own Settings, then
reconnect the PC here. On Windows, extraction always uses `%SystemRoot%\System32\tar.exe`, so Git
or MSYS tools earlier on PATH cannot reinterpret the archive's drive-letter path.

## Building and distributing runtimes

`bun run build:remote` builds for the host OS and CPU after `bun run build`. Linux and macOS bundles use checksum-pinned Node 22.23.2. Linux bundles copy the installed Bun, so they must be built on the target OS/CPU. macOS bundles use checksum-pinned Bun 1.4.2 plus that platform's prebuilt PTY package (`@lydell/node-pty-<platform>`, fetched checksum-pinned from the npm registry when it is not the host's); they can also be assembled on Linux. The Windows bundle (`win32-x64`) is checksum-pinned Bun 1.4.2 alone, with no Node, PTY package or herdr, and is assembled on any OS:

```sh
bun run build:remote darwin-arm64  # Apple Silicon
bun run build:remote win32-x64     # Windows
bun run build:remote darwin-x64    # Intel Mac
```

The builder verifies herdr 0.9.3, all downloaded runtime checksums, macOS executable architectures and PTY helper permissions. Native builds run an actual PTY smoke test. Cross-platform assembly records `native_smoke_tested: false`; the destination runs bundled Bun/herdr and a Node PTY smoke test **before activating** the installed runtime. macOS runtime execution still needs native CI or a real Mac to verify it. No build tools are required on the remote PC.

The connection server first honors an explicit `HERDR_WEB_BUNDLE_MANIFEST`, then automatically uses `remote-bundles/manifest-<target OS>-<target CPU>.json` beside the server checkout, and otherwise downloads the versioned release. Local discovery follows the **remote** architecture, independently of the server OS and launch directory. Invalid local/configured manifests fail closed; they do not fall back to a different runtime.

`.github/workflows/remote-bundles.yml` builds and smoke-tests Linux/macOS × x64/arm64 and Windows x64 (assembled on Linux, started on a Windows runner against herdr's own installer), plus a real SSH password-authentication job on Linux. `scripts/windows-host-qa.ts` runs the whole Add PC flow against a real Windows PC (`WINDOWS_QA_HOST`, `WINDOWS_QA_PASSWORD`). Dispatching the workflow produces artifacts; pushing a `remote-vN` tag, where N is `REMOTE_BUNDLE_VERSION` in `shared/machines.ts`, publishes all five archives and the combined `manifest.json` after the checks pass. Raising `REMOTE_BUNDLE_VERSION` makes every connected PC's bridge incompatible until it is updated (**Update bridge…**), so publish the `remote-vN` release before the app release that carries the new number. Locally built bundles and manifests under `remote-bundles/` must be rebuilt too, since an older manifest there fails closed.

The default manifest is `https://github.com/devswha/herdr-web-ui/releases/download/remote-v<REMOTE_BUNDLE_VERSION>/manifest.json`, with the version from `shared/machines.ts`. Version and SHA-256 checks run on the connection server and SHA-256 is checked again on the remote PC before extraction. Each runtime contains its own version metadata. A malformed/incompatible manifest stops installation before a running bridge is stopped.

## Verification

- `bun test`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run build`: contracts and existing behavior.
- `bun run build:remote && bun scripts/remote-bundle-smoke.ts`: packaged startup, private daemon/socket, authenticated handshake.
- `bun run test:ssh`: actual isolated sshd, fingerprint approval, encrypted-key askpass, app-key registration, first install, two independent herdr daemons with equal pane IDs, HTTP/WS routing, roles, ACK overload, reconnect/restart, cancellation, failed installation, explicit bridge update and host-key-change rejection. Tests write only to their own panes.
- `SSH_TEST_PASSWORD=1 bun run test:ssh`: the same flow with an ephemeral system account and real password login; requires noninteractive sudo, as configured in CI.
- `SSH_TEST_KEEP=1 bun run test:ssh`: keeps the fixture until SIGTERM and prints its JSON path. `bun scripts/machines-browser-qa.ts <fixture.json>` checks PC switching, late real upload responses, drafts/held input, destination labels, and desktop/mobile screenshots under `evidence/machines/`.
- `bun scripts/ssh-password-docker.ts`: real password login to a disposable Debian PC with no Bun/Node/build tools, followed by bundled herdr startup and app-key reconnection; requires Docker and changes no host accounts.
- `bun run test:ui`: existing composer/session/mobile browser regressions.

macOS Codex discovery uses `lsof` for open rollout files instead of `/proc`; canonical-store validation and the unambiguous transcript matching rules are unchanged. Platform jobs must run on their corresponding runners before all-platform release readiness can be claimed. The Docker password test can run locally without sudo; macOS/arm64 binaries still require their corresponding runners.
