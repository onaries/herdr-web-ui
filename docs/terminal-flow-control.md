# Terminal output control and the Bun PTY comparison

Checked on 2026-09-22: Linux x64, Bun 1.4.2, Node 24.18.0, node-pty 1.1.0, xterm 5.5.0, herdr 0.9.0. Since 2026-09-26 node-pty comes as `@lydell/node-pty` 1.1.0, the same code with a prebuilt binary per platform, so nothing compiles at install.

## Decision

Keep xterm and the Node PTY sidecar. Bun.Terminal successfully handled the tested interactive operations and real herdr attaches, but its public API has no output `pause()`/`resume()`. Its `drain` callback concerns `terminal.write()` input, not consumption of child output. Removing node-pty would remove the upstream read control used below. Do not substitute `unref()` or suspend the whole attach process: input, including Ctrl+C, must remain live.

This corrects the previous statement that Bun had no PTY API. [Bun.Terminal was introduced in 1.3.5](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.5). See the [current API](https://bun.com/reference/bun/Terminal) and [xterm flow-control guide](https://xtermjs.org/docs/guides/flowcontrol/). Revisit migration when native output control is available, or after validating another bounded, lossless approach. As of 2026-10-20 neither Bun 1.4.3 nor the 1.4.4 canary has it: the request is [oven-sh/bun#41410](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/41410), and [oven-sh/bun#41411](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/41411) adds `Terminal.pause()`/`resume()`, open and unmerged. Revisit once it ships. WebGL remains a separate rendering experiment.

## Implemented behavior

1. The browser attaches with `flow_control: "ack"`. Each subscription gets a fresh `stream_id`; each `pty-data.flow.offset` counts cumulative UTF-8 payload bytes, including the initial replay.
2. Only xterm's `write(data, callback)` callback sends `pty-ack`. This acknowledges parsing, not painting. Callbacks capture both the connection and pane subscription, so stale callbacks cannot acknowledge a new attach. ACKs are never queued while disconnected.
3. At 256 KiB outstanding, pause PTY reads. Resume when all remaining consumers are below their application watermark (<=64 KiB) and their transport queues have room. Input and resize remain available while output is paused.
4. A blocked client whose ACKs have not advanced for 2 seconds, plus the time its oldest unacknowledged frame needs to cross a 32 KiB/s link as serialized (that ACK cannot come sooner), is closed with code 4008 and removed from all attachments, releasing healthy peers. Every ACK that moves restarts that clock, so a client still draining a large backlog is not closed; one client may still hold the PTY paused for at most 10 s in a row, however it acknowledges, so a byte-at-a-time ACK or a very slow phone cannot cap its peers at its own rate. A late joiner's first ACK can only come once its whole replay frame has crossed the link and been parsed, so until then it gets a budget sized to that frame as serialized, JSON escaping included, plus whatever the socket already had queued ahead of it (on a reconnect every attached pane's replay goes out back to back): 2 s plus those bytes at 32 KiB/s, at most 15 s. A joiner within that budget never pauses the PTY the other clients share; its own window is still bounded by the hard budget. The WebSocket send queue is shared by every pane on the connection, so it counts against a pane only while that pane has more than the low watermark of its own outstanding: a quiet, acknowledged split pane is never paused or closed for its neighbour's backlog (the neighbour's own window answers for it, and the 1 MiB transport budget still applies). There is a 1 MiB hard payload budget per ACK subscription and a separate 1 MiB WebSocket transport budget, including JSON escaping. Already-read pipe data can arrive after pausing; the hard budget covers that overshoot.
5. The browser shows an overload notice and a Reconnect button, and does not automatically reconnect into another overload. The button attaches the selected pane again in place with a fresh terminal (no page reload); switching panes also reconnects. One exception: a 4008 that came while the page was hidden, or within 5 seconds of it being shown again (a frozen page sends no ACKs, and reads the close only once it resumes), is the page's freeze rather than a slow device, so the pane attaches again by itself once, when the page is back in use. A 4008 while the page stays in use is final. A new attach waits for the retiring process to release herdr's attach slot. The original herdr pane is not killed.
6. The sidecar also honors `stdout.write() === false` and `drain`. This gate and the browser pause gate must both clear to resume. The parent consumes the final stdout bytes before reporting process exit; terminating a paused sidecar resumes its reader to observe EOF and bounds forced cleanup.

`send() === -1` means Bun already queued the frame; resending would duplicate terminal bytes. A failed delivery stops the connection. Duplicate attaches no longer replay bytes twice. Duplicate, stale or out-of-order ACKs cannot release additional credit; future/non-integer offsets in the active subscription receive `invalid_ack`. Observers can ACK but still cannot type or resize.

Clients without `flow_control` retain wire compatibility and the transport cap, but have no xterm parser credit. Reload an older browser client to use the complete path.

The replay tail is 128 KiB, half the high-water mark, so a join does not block the joiner's window by itself. It counts UTF-8 bytes and avoids splitting a code point. It is still a stream tail, not a serialized terminal snapshot: arbitrary ANSI state cannot be reconstructed reliably from every possible tail. Overload does not silently discard chunks and continue displaying a supposedly complete live stream. Ordinary/manual reattachment retains the existing replay limitation.

## Verification and comparison

Reproduce using only newly created `ovis-test-*` workspaces:

```sh
bun test server/pty/session.test.ts server/output-window.test.ts server/output.contract.test.ts
bun scripts/pty-compare.ts 30
bun run build
bun scripts/output-browser-qa.ts
bun scripts/ui-regression.ts
```

The comparison script's native adapter is experimental and is never selected by the server. Both backends passed TTY detection, Korean/emoji input, resize, Ctrl+C input, final output, exit-code reporting, a real `herdr terminal attach`, and attach-process cleanup. Each then streamed 49,152,000 bytes of Korean/emoji output over roughly 30 seconds; SHA-256 and byte counts matched exactly.

| One comparison run | Node sidecar | Bun.Terminal |
|---|---:|---:|
| Interactive startup | 51 ms | 21 ms |
| Ctrl+C response, polled every 10 ms | 10 ms | 10 ms |
| Sustained-output elapsed time | 30,632 ms | 32,104 ms |
| Sampled peak process-tree RSS | 167,204 KiB | 105,384 KiB |
| Output read pause/resume available | Yes | No |

RSS includes the comparison runner and producer, plus the Node host for the sidecar case. The same runner executes the cases sequentially; warm-up, garbage collection and other machine activity were not controlled. These are one-run observations, not a general performance ranking, a leak verdict or a multi-hour soak test.

The contract tests use real herdr redraw traffic to verify stalled-observer eviction, bounded outstanding bytes, operator continuation, live Ctrl+C input, stale ACK rejection and valid-ACK resumption. PTY tests separately verify split UTF-8, final multi-megabyte output before exit, paused output with working input, and cleanup while paused. Browser QA drives the real built UI and xterm, withholding only outgoing ACKs to verify the notice, absence of an automatic reconnect loop, recovery by the Reconnect button and by pane selection, and the one re-attach when a page put away (visibility faked) is shown again. Test workspaces and servers are cleaned up.

During validation, a pre-existing local node-pty binary linked against the system `libnode.so.109` crashed at shutdown under the active Node 24 runtime. Rebuilding with the active Node installation's bundled node-gyp and matching headers removed that linkage and the crash. The distro node-gyp build reintroduced the bad linkage. On a similar mixed installation, inspect `ldd node_modules/node-pty/build/Release/pty.node` and rebuild with the toolchain belonging to the Node executable that runs the sidecar. This applied to the compiled node-pty; the prebuilt distribution installs no toolchain and never runs node-gyp, so a normal install cannot hit it.
