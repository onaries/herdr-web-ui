// ci.yml runs on pushes to main (windows-install.yml has no push trigger). Pushes to main share one group, as in
// oh-my-openagent's ci.yml: a running push run is never cancelled, and a newer push cancels the one still waiting,
// so the newest run covers the merges in between. A manual run (or a caller's, through workflow_dispatch) has a
// group of its own, so it never replaces a waiting push run that Pages deploys from. A pull request keeps one group
// per branch (per caller workflow) and cancels its superseded run. The values are compared whole, as parsed: any
// edit to them has to change this test too.
